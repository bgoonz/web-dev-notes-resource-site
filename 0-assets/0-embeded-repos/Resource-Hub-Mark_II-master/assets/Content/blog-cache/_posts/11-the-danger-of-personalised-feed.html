    <p>Most of the social apps now come with features called <code>personalised feed</code> or <code>personalised
        experience</code>. They claim that they will provide personalised experience to each user differently as per
      their interest and people always buy it.</p>

    <h2 id="why-the-apps-are-giving-you-personalised-feeds">Why the apps are giving you personalised feeds?</h2>
    <p>Because <strong>That’s where they are taking control of the things</strong> what you see or what you read. Nobody
      is gonna question them since what you see in your feed is seen by you only.</p>
    <p>I prefer to have control over things what I see instead of giving control to the app. The moment you give away
      the control to the app, they can inject anything into your feed with a justification, <code>it is
        personalised</code>.</p>
    <p>They will take this as an opportunity to learn and understand about you by asking more and more questions on your
      preferences and likes.</p>
    <p>They provide options like <code>Not Interested</code>, to create a fake sense, you still have control over what
      you see. But in reality, the app decides what you see and what you should read. Whenever you mark each and
      everything <code>Not Interested</code> they are learning more about your preferences.</p>
    <p>These learning can help them to categorize and feed in things accordingly.</p>
    <h2 id="how-this-help-to-unleash-propaganda">How this help to unleash propaganda</h2>
    <p>Consider this app is helping people to unleash political propaganda,</p>
    <p>They will inject items into your <code>personalised feed</code> to make sure you will see as per the propaganda
      people want you to see. They will do this to you until you start to see and think as they want.</p>
    <p>To make this worse, it’s really difficult to investigate, the items you saw in <code>personalised feed</code>
      because they won’t leave any trace. Most time you see the updated items and there is no way to time travel to a
      particular date and time to see how the feed looked like in a given time.</p>
    <p>Adding ads into this make things even worse, but more profitable for app business.</p>
    <p>Recent <a

        Analytica</a> scandal is the same. Facebook played along with political powers to make sure their users will see
      and think what the candidates want to see and change their minds.</p>
    <p>They were successful in unleash propaganda all over the world, even in India. They were partially successful in
      even changing your opinion political inclination, without even knowing you.</p>
    <p>As long as you enjoy the so-called <code>personalised feed</code>, they will keep you enslaved.</p>
