      an opensource project. 2 years before me too was a noob who don't know how to get started with opensource
      contribution. I am not an expert now, but anyway I got started with and I believe I am improving on this. The
      steps I followed in the recent years to get started with it.
    </div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <h3 style="text-align: left;">Use and read opensource code.</h3>
    <div>Use&nbsp;maximum opensource project, in the daily life of programming. Try to read the code, instead of just
      using it. Try to reuse the best parts/ conventions in your works. Reading Opensource code
      will&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;make you a better programmer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <h3>Report bugs if you find any</h3>
    <div>Don't hesitate to report any bug you found in the opensource projects. They will love it. No project is 100%
      perfect.&nbsp;</div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <h3 style="text-align: left;">Propose an enhancement</h3>
    <div>Don't hesitate to propose an enhancement. Don't get demotivated if they rejected it. Anyway they will explain
      why they rejected it. Take it as an&nbsp;opportunity to learn a new thing.&nbsp;</div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <h3 style="text-align: left;">Participate in the&nbsp;discussions&nbsp;on issues</h3>
    <div style="text-align: left;">Try to participate in the discussions on the project. Try &nbsp;to stay upto-date
      with them. Share your ideas and views on the fix or enhancement.&nbsp;</div>
    <div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div>
    <h3 style="text-align: left;">Start with small bug fixes&nbsp;</h3>
    <div>Always start with small. If you find a bug try to fix it.&nbsp;Initially don't try to fix something with total
      rewrite. Continue fix the small things, until the team finds you trust worthy.</div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <h3 style="text-align: left;">Fix thing which you use and love to work</h3>
    <div>Try only&nbsp;contribute/participate&nbsp;on things with you use and love to work. Select a project from your
      favorite language. Don't think I am not good in the something, which you contribute. &nbsp;You can't
      do&nbsp;something&nbsp;after becoming an expert or ninja in that. If you are doing wrong the team will fix
      you.&nbsp;</div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>Don't think that there will be better way to do this. Do it in a way which you know. If there is a better way
      the team will explain and help you to do it.</div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <h3 style="text-align: left;">Try, Try, Try</h3>
    <div>Don't quit, if your first or second&nbsp;contribution&nbsp;is rejected, don't get demotivated. Think it as
      an&nbsp;opportunity to improve yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my case, it's 7&nbsp;contribution is the first one got
      approved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <h3 style="text-align: left;">Find a local geek</h3>
    <div>Find a local geek in your local area, who already&nbsp;contributes. Use social networks to find such geeks.
      Talk to them, share your code with them. Attend meetups to find someone like you and team up. No one will help
      you, until you ask for it, Every one is keen to help you, only thing you need to do is just ask "Can you help
      me?".</div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>In my case I found <a class="g-profile" href="http://plus.google.com/103027363195624770971"
        target="_blank">+Hari K T</a>&nbsp;as friend of friend and talked to him. I found him through twitter, later I
      came to know we have a mutual friend and I got hari's mobile number from him and had a conversation with him. That
      was the first step towards opensource&nbsp;contribution&nbsp;from me. &nbsp;</div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>Now I am proud to say, I am team&nbsp;member&nbsp;of <a class="g-profile"
